                          <h5>Functionality</h5>
                        <p>The Neighbourhood-Inflated Seed Expansion Algorithm (NISE) <cite>[WGDh16]</cite> is an overlapping community detection algorithm, which works on the method of seed expansion and therefore relies on finding good seeds efficiently. The four phases of the algorithm are: filtering, seeding, seed expansion and propagation.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Filtering: Given a graph $G$, the filtering phase creates a subgraph $G'$, which has the property of remaining connected after removing any edge. The maximal subgraph with this property is called the "biconnected core".</li>
                            <li>Seeding: The seeding strategy implemented here is called SpreadHubs. It greedily chooses an  independent set of $k$ ($k$ is being set by the user in the variable "seedCount") nodes in the graph by looking at the degree of the nodes. In the beginning all nodes are unmarked and until $k$ nodes are found, the highest degree unmarked node is selected as a seed and its neighbours are being marked. If there is more than one node with a maximal degree, the algorithm takes an independent set of the unmarked nodes.</li>
                            <li>Seed expansion: Now the seed communities need to be expanded. This is being done by a personalized Page Rank vector (also: random-walk with restart). With probability $p$ it takes a step of the random walk and with probability $1-p$ it jumps back to the a randomly chosen seed node. Therefore nodes, which are close to a seed node, are visited more often. </li>
                            <li>Propagation: During the last phase, the nodes which have been detached in the filtering phase earlier are being reattached. Those whiskers are connected to $G$ by only one edge. Therefore they are being added to the communities which the node on the other side of that edge has.</li>
                          </ol>
